    "                - Use a clear heading (e.g., “Topic: Compliance & Frameworks”).\n",
    "                - Present bullet points covering key facts, explanations, and names/figures mentioned.\n",
    "                4. Under a separate **Decisions** heading, list every decision made (e.g., “Start SOC 2 Type 1 audit by end of quarter,” “Engage Assurance Lab as auditor”).\n",
    "                5. Under **Action Items**, list each task, assigning it to a person or team when possible and noting any deadlines (e.g., “Victor to send detailed pricing breakdown by June 6,” “Client to discuss evaluation feedback with co-founders by next week”).\"\n",
    "                6. Include all relevant names, concepts, and figures (e.g., “SOC 2 Type 1,” “$12 000/year for the Foundation package,” “Auditor #1 fee ~$6 000”), and do not omit any important detail.\n",
    "                7. Keep bullets short (no more than two sentences each) and order them logically under each heading.\n",

    "                - Headings in bold (e.g., **Topic: Audit Preparation & Support**).  \n",
    "                - Sub-bullets only if needed for clarification.\n",
    "                9. If the same issue was raised multiple times, combine those references under a single bullet and note that it recurred.\n",
    "                10. Write in neutral, business-formal tone, as if these notes will be shared with senior leadership.\n",
