# Random Stuff

Random stuff that I did for fun, or not.

- Small RAG projects for fun

- A `summarize-emails` file that helps me get a news summary of my favorite newletters (that I label "news" in my Gmail account)

- An `emailing` outreach assistant that I used when I was working on industrializing the outbound of a startup

- A `db-enrichment.ipynb` that I used to get knowledge when I was working on the outbound of a startup

- A `speech-transcript-notes.ipynb` that I used to create calls notes when I was working for a startup, since I was not satisfied with the paid webapps
